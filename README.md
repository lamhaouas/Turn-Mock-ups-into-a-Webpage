# Turn Mock-ups Into a Web Page
Turn mock up into a web page is my first project,
I used HTML and CSS only, no framework or a pre-compiler for this project (like SASS for instance).
The layout is responsive using media queries, CSS flexbox and CSS grid.
The code was tracked with version control where I used Gitbash and practice the command lines.
